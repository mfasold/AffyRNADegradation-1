Description: The package helps with the assessment and correction of RNA
  degradation effects in Affymetrix 3' expression arrays. The parameter d
  gives a robust and accurate measure of RNA integrity. The correction
  removes the probe positional bias, and thus improves comparability of
  samples that are affected by RNA degradation.
